## Architecture

The application is built with a **feature-first** architecture, separating concerns into logical directories under the `src` folder:

### Key Directories

- **`src/actions`**: Server-side logic for tracking user and challenge progress.
- **`src/app`**: Core application pages and layouts, organized by functionality:
  - **`(main)`**: The main user interface, including courses and learning modules.
  - **`(marketing)`**: Landing and promotional pages.
  - **Reusable Layouts**: Shared structure for pages like `layout.tsx`.
- **`src/components`**: Modular UI components and modal dialogs.
- **`src/db`**: Drizzle ORM configuration, schema definitions, and queries.
- **`src/hooks`**: Custom React hooks for shared logic.
- **`src/lib`**: Utility functions for common operations.
- **`src/scripts`**: Scripts for database seeding and maintenance.
- **`src/store`**: Context and state management for modal interactions.
